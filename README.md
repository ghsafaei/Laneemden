# Laneemden

!c**************************************************************
!c* program to solve the Lane-Emden equation numerically       *
!c*                                                            *
!c* the equation to solve is                                   *
!c* d^2x/dt^2 = - ((2/t)*(dx/dt) + x**n)                       *
!c*                                                            *
!c* where x is the dimensionless density function (psi)        *
!c* and t is the dimensionless length (xi)                     *
!c* initial conditions are      x = 1 and dx/dt = 0            *
!c*                                                            *
!c* and the power index is n.                                  *
!c* analytical solutions are known for n=0, 1, 5.              *
!c*                                                            *                                             *
